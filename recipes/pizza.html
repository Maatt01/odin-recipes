    <h1>Description</h1>
    This is a Pepperoni Pizza recipe
    <p></p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
        <li>250g passata</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sun-dried tomato purée (or regular tomato purée)</li>
        <li>A few fresh oregano sprigs, leaves picked (or 2 tsp dried oregano)</li>
        <li>2 x 125g balls fresh mozzarella, torn</li>
        <li>100g sliced pepperoni or chorizo</li>
        <li>Fresh basil and Parmesan shavings to serve</li>
        For the Pizza Base
        <li>225g strong plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>1½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>7g sachet fast-action dried yeast</li>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Method</h1>
   <ol>
       <li>To make the pizza base, sift the flour and salt into a large bowl, then stir in the sugar and yeast. Measure 150ml lukewarm water in a jug. Make a well in the centre of the flour and pour in the oil and a little of the water. With lightly oiled hands, gradually mix the flour into the liquid, adding a little more water until it comes together (you may not need it all).</li>
       <li>Dust a work surface with flour. Tip out the dough, scraping out any that sticks to the bowl. Knead for 5-10 minutes until smooth and soft. Put in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave in a warm place for 1 hour until doubled in size.</li>
       <li>To make the sauce, heat the oil in a sauté pan, then gently fry the garlic for 30 seconds. Add the passata, tomato purée and oregano, then season well. Simmer for 10 minutes or so until reduced to a spreadable sauce, then set aside.</li>
       <li>Preheat the oven to its highest temperature with 2 baking sheets inside. Gently knock the air out of the dough and divide in half. Knead each piece briefly on a lightly floured surface, then, rolling and pulling gently with your hands, stretch out the dough to fit the baking sheets (about 27cm). Don’t worry if they’re misshapen. Put each base on a sheet of baking paper to help transfer them to the oven.</li>
    <li>Spread each base with 2 tbsp of the tomato sauce, then dot with the mozzarella and pepperoni. Transfer the pizzas to the preheated baking sheets (still on the baking paper)</li>
    <li>and bake for 10-12 minutes until the bases are crisp. Scatter with basil and Parmesan, then serve.</li>

   </ol>
